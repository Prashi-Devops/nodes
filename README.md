# <a href="#top" id="top"></a>Creating a New Service Type

The purpose of this document is to list the necessary steps for adding a new ServiceType to SIF (both ServiceRamp and CIS), creating the release-pipeline test artifacts and default user credentials.

When a new ServiceType is requested, each of the following areas should be included as a Jira task.  The grooming information for each task should be copied from this document's associated section.

##  <a href="#prerequisite" id="prerequisite"></a>PreRequisites

When a new Service Type is defined, the following are the pre-requisites to creating artifacts.

* Standard eBond definition for service type

  * https://github.dxc.com/pages/Platform-DXC/integration-ebond/std-ebond/strategic/

* ICD and DMW Document

  * https://github.dxc.com/pages/Platform-DXC/integration-ebond/document-templates/legacy

* Swagger definition (that includes the request / response definitions)

  * https://github.dxc.com/Platform-DXC/integration-api/blob/master/apis/readme.md
  * The API must be deployed to the AWS sandbox environment

* Mapping Document for request/response to CIS internal schemas

  * https://dxcportal.sharepoint.com/sites/IntegrationFramework
  * In the Inventory/00Common/External/Schemas within the directory associated with the ServiceType (xlsx spreadsheet)

* List of lookup table values required for translation to ConnectNow (application level)

  * https://dxcportal.sharepoint.com/sites/IntegrationFramework
  * In the Inventory/00Common/External/Schemas within the directory associated with the ServiceType (xlsx spreadsheet)

* Model document to be shared in ServiceRamp which specifies the predefined lookup tables

  * https://dxcportal.sharepoint.com/sites/IntegrationFramework
  * In the Inventory/00Common/External/Schemas within the directory associated with the ServiceType (model document)

* Define tests and use cases

  * These can be based off of the work instructions:  https://dxcportal.sharepoint.com/sites/edge/sar/docs/edge/cap_esm
  * There may be multiple work instructions for a single service type
  * Additional test cases may be needed based on design requirements
  * Define both positive and negative test cases
  * All response codes supported by the API will have at least one test case defined

* Define the ServiceNow data needed to carry out the tests

  * This includes users, roles, and foundation data

* Onboard the data into ServiceNow needed to perform the tests

  * The data needs to be onboarded identically in all supported ServiceNow instances
  * The naming convention used for the data should be documented for consistency and repeatability

* Create or obtain ServiceNow credentials for use in all supported ServiceNow environments.

  * The standard user name convention for eBonds is pdxc.\<serviceType>.integration (e.g. _pdxc.change.integration)_
  * Request/Reply has an existing _pdxc.requestreply.api.gateway.integration_ user
  * ServiceRamp uses an existing _pdxc.onboarding.integration_ user
  * Additional users may be required based on use case definitions (e.g. a self-service user vs. an 'approver' with additional roles may both be needed to cover a specific use case)
  * Supply credentials to the Integration Team for use in creating the test packages

> All request schemas should come predefined with 10 custom fields.  If the schema does not have this, then go back to the Architecture team for verification.

##  <a href="#servicetype" id="servicetype"></a>ServiceType

*Requirement*

  Add the ability to create artifacts in ServiceRamp related to a Service Type that does not yet exist.

*Pre-Requisites*

  Architecture team has provided the name of the Service Type and a one sentence description to be displayed on the Create Flow screen.

*Description*

* Steps to introduce a new service type in Service Ramp :
       	
	* Insert a row into [SSP_DB].[dbo].[ServiceType] table with values of new Service Type
	* Insert a row into [SSP_DB].[dbo].[ServiceOffering] using ID of the new serviceType of above step
	* Change Status to 1 in [SSP_DB].[dbo].[ServiceType] of the new service type row when it is ready to be used
	* Insert rows into [SSP_DB].[dbo].[TemplateDrawingSelector] table with values of new Service Type based on ServiceOfferingId 
	* Insert rows into [SSP_DB].[dbo].[TransactionType] table with values of new Service Type based on ServiceOfferingId

* Low level instructions:
	* Include in the Post deployment script ReferenceData_ServiceType.sql the new service type.
	* Include in the Post deployment script ReferenceData_ServiceOfferinf.sql the new service offering related to the new service type.
 
 
*Success Criteria*

* When a user logs into ServiceRamp, the following are true:
	*   In the Flow Overview screen, the left pane list of Service Types includes the new Service Type
	*   In the Flow Summary screen, a new box is displayed with the New ServiceType
*   In the Create Flow - Flow Setup screen, a new box is displayed with the new Service Type and the one sentence description provided by Architecture.
*   A template, flow, flow segment, lookup table, etc. can be created for the new Service Type

* The Rapid Deploy package contains post deployment scripts for the ServiceType and ServiceOffering

*Output*

* Post deployment script ReferenceData_ServiceType.sql the new service type
* Post deployment script ReferenceData_ServiceOfferinf.sql the new service offering related to the new service type

*Outcome*

Once the success criteria is complete, a ServiceRamp Engineer can configure a Service Types artifacts.

##  <a href="#schema" id="schema"></a>Schema 

*Requirement*

Provide in ServiceRamp a schema for the Service Type that matches the swagger definition and the data model.

*Pre-Requisites*
* API Swagger documentation
* XSD document in Sharepoint provided by Architecture https://dxcportal.sharepoint.com/sites/IntegrationFramework/Inventory/00_Common/External/Schema/

*Description*

* Ensure that any "simple" array structures have been converted to  "complex" array structures 
	* These are instructions to make changes to handle arrays for eBond schemas (i.e. LiteChangeV2, LiteIncidentV2, ...etc). Reason for changing the structure is two-fold:
		* The svcutil.exe will generate the datacontract without errors (otherwise it fails) 	
		* This JSON generated from the XML structure (using the datacontract) will match the JSON expected by ConnectNow. 
### Wrong way :

```xml
<xs:element name="affectedCis" maxOccurs="unbounded" minOccurs="0" type="xs:string">
```

### Correct way :


```xml
<xs:element name="affectedCis" minOccurs="0">
      <xs:complexType>
           <xs:sequence>
                 <xs:element maxOccurs="unbounded" minOccurs="0" name="string" type="xs:string" />
            </xs:sequence>
       </xs:complexType>
 </xs:element>
```

* Upload the schema into ServiceRamp Sandbox (get temporary Engineer access)
	* Enter the new ServiceType in Schema Name textbox
	* Ensure Canonical Schema is checked
	* Ensure Canonical Type is External
	* Select the correct ServiceType
	* Upload the XSD Schema/WSDL(s) file using Browse option
	* Update the task for SR Rapid deployment with the name and path of the Schema XSD

*Naming Convention*

* [SchemaType][Dataconcept][Version]. Example:  LiteChangeV2

*Deliverables*

* XSD for message format defined using specified criteria
* XSD loaded into ServiceRamp Sandbox
* Rapid Deploy task updated with Schema name

*Success Criteria*

* The XSD needs to be stored in SR SB AWS (as a source resource)
* xsd matches the definition of the message to be used in PDXC ebonds 
* Latest xsd is in sharepoint 
* SR Rapid Deploy task includes the latest xsd
* The database has been validated that the correct settings are in place to ensure that the Schema will show up when selecting schemas for the Service Type
* Test Document created and uploaded to the Jira task
* Review by a tech lead

*Outcome*

* Once this story is complete, the schema will be available in ServiceRamp ready for specifying in Templates and Maps.

##  <a href="#rxsd" id="rxsd"></a>XSD
* ServiceRamp currently requires the schema to be defined in xsd format with the following special considerations

These are instructions to make changes to handle arrays for eBond schemas (i.e. LiteChangeV2, LiteIncidentV2, ...etc). Reason for changing the structure is two-fold:
 * The svcutil.exe will generate the datacontract without errors (otherwise it fails)
 * This JSON generated from the XML structure (using the datacontract) will match the JSON expected by ConnectNow. 

#### Wrong way for eBond lite schemas:

```xml
<xs:element name="affectedCis" maxOccurs="unbounded" minOccurs="0" type="xs:string">
```
 

#### Correct way for eBond lite schemas:

```xml
<xs:element name="affectedCis" minOccurs="0">
      <xs:complexType>
           <xs:sequence>
                 <xs:element maxOccurs="unbounded" minOccurs="0" name="string" type="xs:string" />
            </xs:sequence>
       </xs:complexType>
 </xs:element>
```

### DataContract
Use svcutil.exe to generate the datacontract.

## <a href="#testing" id="testing"></a>Testing

This activity has six stories associated with it.

### Story 1 - Define Test Data for Each Environment

**Pre-requisites:**

* The test data for [ServiceType] must be present in the ServiceNow environments
* ServiceNow Credentials to use for Testing in all supported ServiceNow environments must be available
* The ebdApiUser credentials should already exist in the AWS environments and can be obtained from EC2 or pulled via deploy.sh
* The DMW for [ServiceType] needs to be created

**Outputs:**

Postman Environment files for each supported AWS environment.

**Description:**

Obtain data specific to the [ServiceType] to utilize in the environment files for the Integration Tests.  The data is environment-specific and will need to be validated against each environment before the testing package can be released into the release-pipeline.  This data should be associated to a test company, not a live customer.

A single environment file should be created which supports both eBond and Request/Reply for a given [ServiceType] since the data overlaps.

**Naming Convention:**

There currently is no naming convention defined for the specific data points as we are using existing data for a test company.  If the need exists to directly onboard data in support of this task a naming convention should be documented for consistency and repeatability.  Onboarding of test data is included as a pre-requisite for any service type.

The output files will follow the [Postman Test Collection Standards|https://github.dxc.com/Platform-DXC/integration-aas/blob/master/docs/PostmanIntegrationTestStandards.md] naming conventions.

**Success Criteria:**

 * All [ServiceType] data points necessary to support testing for each supported ServiceNow environment have been obtained
 * Postman Environment files for each supported AWS environment have been created.  NOTE:  These file will have to be checked in with the Integration Test package rather than independently due to the way the packaging works in the integration-ebond repository.

### Story 2 - Add New User Credentials to SSM in all AWS Environments

>NOTE:  This task only applies if new credentials were created.  This is typically only required when a new eBond ServiceType is being introduced, and won't apply when Request/Reply is being implemented.

**Pre-requisites:**

* ServiceNow Credentials to use for Testing in all supported ServiceNow environments must be available

**Outputs:**

* Shell scripts for adding new entries into SSM in each AWS instance.  One script is needed for each supported AWS instance.
* SSM Parameter Store entries for all credentials used for testing.

>NOTE:  The scripts _cannot_ be stored in GitHub as that would expose the credentials and create a security violation.

**Description:**

Generate a shell script for each AWS environment which contains the Base64 encoded value for each new set of credentials required for testing.

The script command will follow this pattern:  
`aws ssm put-parameter --name ebd_<serviceType>_integration_user --type "SecureString" --value "cGR4Yy5zZXJ2aWNldHlwZS51c2VyOmJhZHB3ZA==" --overwrite`

The 'name' value will follow the naming convention specified below.

The 'value' will be the base64 endcoded `uid:pwd` value.

Provide the scripts to the infra-core team for implementation.  Note that the Integration Team can typically run the scripts against Sandbox and Infra-core is only needed for the higher environments.

**Naming Convention:**

The SSM value `name` should be prefixed with `ebd` and suffixed with `integration_user`.  The ServiceType value should be reflective of the actual user name.  For example, user `pdxc.change.integration` would use `change` for the serviceType value, resulting in `ebd_change_integration_user` as the `name` value for SSM.

**Success Criteria:**

 * All new credential values have been added to the SSM Parameter store in each supported AWS instance. 

### Story 3 - Define [ServiceType] Test Data for Each Environment

**Pre-requisites:**

* The test data for [ServiceType] must be present in the ServiceNow environments
* ServiceNow Credentials to use for Testing in all supported ServiceNow environments must be available.
* The ebdApiUser credentials should already exist in the AWS environments and can be obtained from EC2 or pulled via deploy.sh
* The DMW for [ServiceType] needs to be created

**Outputs:**

Postman Environment files for each supported AWS environment.

**Description:**

Obtain data specific to the [ServiceType] to utilize in the environment files for the Integration Tests.  The data is environment-specific and will need to be validated against each environment before the testing package can be released into the release-pipeline.  This data should be associated to a test company, not a live customer.

A single environment file should be created which supports both eBond and Request/Reply for a given [ServiceType] since the data overlaps.

**Naming Convention:**

There currently is no naming convention defined for the specific data points as we are using existing data for a test company.  If the need exists to directly onboard data in support of this task a naming convention should be documented for consistency and repeatability.  Onboarding of test data is included as a pre-requisite for any service type.

The output files will follow the [Postman Test Collection Standards|https://github.dxc.com/Platform-DXC/integration-aas/blob/master/docs/PostmanIntegrationTestStandards.md] naming conventions.

**Success Criteria:**

 * All [ServiceType] data points necessary to support testing for each supported ServiceNow environment have been obtained
 * Postman Environment files for each supported AWS environment have been created.  NOTE:  These file will have to be checked in with the Integration Test package rather than independently due to the way the packaging works in the integration-ebond repository.

### Story 4 - Create [ServiceType] API Integration Test - Postman Collection

**Pre-requisites:**

 * Test data and credentials for at least one ServiceNow environment should be available before proceeding, although it is possible to begin shelling out the collection while waiting on that information to be provided.
 * The DMW must be completed for the [ServiceType].
 * The [ServiceType] API must be deployed into AWS Sandbox.
 * ConnectNow and ServiceNow coding changes required to support the [ServiceType] must be completed and available in cscdev ServiceNow in order to support testing.

**Outputs:**

 A Postman collection and associated environment files for the [ServiceType].

**Description:**

* Prepare Integration Test Cases which cover all defined test cases
* Utilize environment files which cover all supported ServiceNow instances

**Naming Convention:**

Testing files should follow the standards in the [Postman Test Collection Standards|https://github.dxc.com/Platform-DXC/integration-aas/blob/master/docs/PostmanIntegrationTestStandards.md]

**Success Criteria:**

* The Integration Test collection performs testing of all defined test cases
* The Integration Test collection can successfully be run against all supported ServiceNow environments

### Story 5 - Create SOAP Test for [ServiceType]

**Pre-Requisites:**
 * Service Ramp flows must be available and published to support these requests. 
 * The [ServiceType] API must be published and working in the API Gateway for the selected test environment.

**Outputs:**

A Postman collection which can be used for making a successful SOAP call to the [ServiceType] API using a published ServiceRamp flow. 

**Description:**

Create a SOAP Test in POSTMAN which can call a flow in ServiceRamp and successfully create a [ServiceType] item in ServiceNow.

Examples and details can be found [here|https://github.dxc.com/Platform-DXC/integration-serviceramp/tree/master/testing/sanityTests].

**Naming Convention:**

 Follow the naming standards in the [Postman Test Collection Standards|https://github.dxc.com/Platform-DXC/integration-aas/blob/master/docs/PostmanIntegrationTestStandards.md].

**Success Criteria:**

 * A SOAP request can be successfully sent from Postman through the ServiceRamp flow for [ServiceType]
 * The ServiceNow [ServiceType] item is successfully created and all fields sent in with the request are present in the appropriate fields.
 * The Postman tests used for testing have been merged into Github (integration-serviceramp/testing/sanityTests)

### Story 6 - Create Integration Test Package and Update deploy.sh

**Pre-requisites:**

* The Postman Integration Test collections for [ServiceType] must be created and validated to be successfully in local testing.
* The environment files for each Supported ServiceNow environment for [ServiceType] must be validated to contain valid data during local testing.
* The [ServiceType] API must be deployed into the release pipeline (above DEV) before or in parallel with releasing the test package into the release-pipeline.

>NOTE:  For a **new** API, ensure the API package has been added to the release-pipeline so that is available in the TEST environment when the test package is marked stable.

**Outputs:**

 A tests-integration-api-core package in Artifactory which contains the tests for [ServiceType].

**Description:**

Files for this task are contained in the [integration-ebond|https://github.dxc.com/Platform-DXC/integration-ebond] repository.

The deployment guide for the integration-ebond repository test package can be found [here|https://github.dxc.com/Platform-DXC/integration-ebond/blob/master/docs/DeploymentGuide.md].

**Naming Convention:**

 * The Postman test collections have been named according to the [Postman Test Collection Standards|https://github.dxc.com/Platform-DXC/integration-aas/blob/master/docs/PostmanIntegrationTestStandards.md]. 
 * The Artifactory package must be named tests-integration-api-core.

**Success Criteria:**

 * The Changelog for tests-integration-api-core has been updated with details of the changes for incorporating [ServiceType] Tests
 * The major version for tests-integration-api-core has been incremented when a NEW collection is added.  If an existing collection is updated only the minor version will increment
 * The deploy.sh file has been updated to execute the test collections for [ServiceType]
 * The tests-integration-api-core package containing the [ServiceType] test collections is marked stable in Artifactory
 * The tests-integration-api-core package containing the [ServiceType] test collections has executed without error in all supported AWS instances.
